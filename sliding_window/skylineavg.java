package sliding_window;

// You are an architect designing a street with houses represented as a 0-indexed array 
// house_heights of n integers, where each element represents the height of a house. 
// Additionally, a binary array visibility_mask of length n is provided, where 1 indicates 
// a house that contributes to the neighborhood's skyline, and 0 indicates a house that does not.

// For any house located at index i, you are tasked with determining the average 
// skyline height within a k-radius neighborhood centered at i. The average skyline 
// height is the average of all house heights between indices i - k and i + k (inclusive) 
// that have a corresponding visibility value of 1 in the visibility_mask. 

// If no houses with a visibility of 1 exist in the range, or if the range extends 
// beyond the boundaries of the array, the average skyline height for that house is -1.

// Return an array skyline_avgs of length n, where skyline_avgs[i] is the average 
// skyline height for the neighborhood centered at index i.

// Example 1:
// Input:
// house_heights = [10, 15, 20, 5, 30, 25, 40]
// visibility_mask = [1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]
// k = 2

// Output:
// skyline_avgs = [-1, -1, 11, 16, 22, -1, -1]


// Explanation:
// - For index 0, there are less than k houses in the left neighborhood, 
//   so skyline_avgs[0] = -1.
// - For index 1, there are less than k houses in the left neighborhood, 
//   so skyline_avgs[1] = -1.
// - For index 2, the neighborhood is [10, 15, 20, 5, 30]. From the visibility_mask, 
//   only the houses with heights [10, 20, 5] contribute to the skyline. The average 
//   is (10 + 20 + 5) / 3 = 11.
// - For index 3, the neighborhood is [15, 20, 5, 30, 25]. From the visibility_mask, 
//   only the houses with heights [20, 5, 25] contribute. 
//   The average is (20 + 5 + 25) / 3 = 16.
// - For index 4, the neighborhood is [20, 5, 30, 25, 40]. From the visibility_mask, 
//   only the houses with heights [20, 5, 25, 40] contribute. The average 
//   is (20 + 5 + 25 + 40) / 4 = 22.
// - For index 5, there are less than k houses in the right neighborhood, 
//   so skyline_avgs[5] = -1.
// - For index 6, there are less than k houses in the right neighborhood, 
//   so skyline_avgs[6] = -1.

// Sample Input:
// 3
// 50 60 70
// 1 1 1
// 1

// Sample Output:
// [-1, 60, -1]

// Constraints:
// 1. n == house_heights.length == visibility_mask.length
// 2. 1 <= n <= 10^5
// 3. 0 <= house_heights[i] <= 10^5
// 4. visibility_mask[i] is either 0 or 1
// 5. 0 <= k <= n
